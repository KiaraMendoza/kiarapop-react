This is a project made for the KeepCoding's Web Development Bootcamp. I hope you like it and send feedback to improve!

On the latest revision I changed the backend so now please use the Keepcodings one!

## Install -- First initialize the backend first!

npm install
```

Copy .env.example to .env and review the settings to adjust them to yours.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
